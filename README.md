## ABOUT ME
Curious, enthusiastic and a jack-of-all-trades, I recently graduated from ENJMIN with a Master in Game Programming. While I mainly am a gameplay programmer, I enjoy toying with UI, tools, and every other aspect of game development! I’m currently working as a Generalist Programmer at Toe Bean Club.

I am not afraid to learn and love trying out new things, growing and pouring my passion into making games.

Outside of game development, I love baking and cooking, tea, cats, books and comics, collecting DVDs, longboarding, board games, watching movies, anime and series, and of course, video games!

❗️All projects on my Github should have a README file attached for more information.
