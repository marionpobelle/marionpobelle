## ABOUT ME

Student @ CNAM-ENJMIN, Angoulême - Master JMIN - Video Games Software Engineering Major.

Hi, I'm Marion ! Curious, a jack-of-all-trades and enthusiastic, I make it a point of honor to invest myself fully in whatever I undertake. I love Gameplay programming, but I'm also interested in Tool programming. I'm looking for opportunities that will enable me to develop my video game programming skills, but also to experiment with the development of other interactive applications.

I love learning new skills and seeing how far I can push them. In my spare time, I enjoy longboarding and baking.

❗️All projects should have a README file attached for more information.

## CURRENT WORK & FUTURE PROJECTS

I am currently working with the french National Museum of Natural History for the summer, as part of my Master’s program. I am task with prototyping some game ideas for them.

## MAIN PROJECTS
### Puppy Guards
Puppy Guards is a 2 - 4 players cooperative couch game in which players take on the role of museum watchmen in charge of protecting the art pieces from at best clumsy, at worst malicious visitors !\
Build barricades with furniture, bark at the visitors or knock them down. Everything is worth it to save the relics from the disaster !
